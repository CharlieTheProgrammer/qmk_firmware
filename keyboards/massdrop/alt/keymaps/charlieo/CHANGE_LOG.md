* Original FN key has been swapped for right alt.
* Right alt is now right Ctrl.
* Caps Lock hold is now FN.
* Bottom left mods went from Ctrl, LGUI, Alt to LGUI, Alt, Ctrl. This is make the layout more similar to Mac.
* Added second layer via Caps Lock hold + Space.
* 2 layer w is MAGIC_UNSWAP_LCTL_LGUI, m is MAGIC_SWAP_LCTL_LGUI. This is to make the keyboard function similarly when switching between Windows and Mac OS.
